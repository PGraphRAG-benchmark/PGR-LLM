The shelf label is there just not the correct product.

The gear circle didn't except for an answer button and volume control. When I learned I can finally skip tracks and pause I was excited. I only take one star off because of the design of the outside part of the earbud itself. I use these headphones for everything. So one personal preference I noticed is I can't lay down on my sides in my bed comfortably with these on. Gear circle had a flat design on the outside. These U Pro have a triangular design that faces out. Reasonable when your trying to put them in your ear you get a nice grip, but it's not worth it for me once I lay down. Laying on my back it feels fine, fits comfortably in the back of my kneck. It's so light sometimes I forget it's on. It's also compatible with my S2 tablet and iPad mini 2. Sounds amazing on the ipad, controls even work, only thing is Apple app Store doesn't carry the Samsung level app. I'm very happy with my purchase and I hope Samsung can take suggestions to better their future products.",

I bought these because the person I asked in best buy said they were one of the few earbuds they had that had the noise cancellation feature and were a reasonable price and that was what I was looking for. I was worried when buying them that I would not like the headset resting on my neck but was told I could return them after 15 days if I wasn't happy. I don't even notice it sitting on my neck, they are also comfortable fit in the ear and don't hurt my ears as some earbuds have in the past. Recommend these if your goal is trying to block out outside noise.",

                "review_text": "I went to Best Buy with the intent to get the latest LG version of these since my brother in law recommended them. However, when I was there I looked at all the versions sold there. I did not want to pay much over $200 but since these, the LGs and several others were below, I had a decent selection to chose from. Reviewing the specs, I found them as good or better in most regards to the others, even the most expensive ones, and they included active noise cancellation. Since I was about to travel, this elevated these to near the top. The sale price and reviews pushed them over the top. I've been into high end audio for a long time. I like neutral sounding speakers so that the music sounds as it's supposed to. I paired these to my Galaxy S7 Edge, which was another reason I purchased these. These fit the bill. They are neutral sounding with good seperation and location of sound field (when the sound travels from one side to the other). There's a bit if reduction as it travels to right through the center but you have to be listening for it for it to stand out. Noise cancellation is acceptable. It helps out a bit but not as much as I expected. I read a review that said they thought it was about 80% improvement. I think it's lower, more like 60-70%. Although one of the reasons I purchased these was the noise canceling, I would not recommend these if noise canceling was the primary reason you want headphones. Although I have not experienced many others, they failed to meet my expectations in this regard. An important note, I was listening to an audiobook on the plane and there was a metallic, digital artifact happening. I couldn't figure out what was happening. I turned the noise cancellation on and off, repaired the headset, turned the phone on and off and various other attempts at fixing the issue to no avail. I finally figured out the was a high definition audio setting that is on the S7 that was supposed to smooth out the audio and create a less digital sounding experience. However, this Samsung setting does not work with the Samsung headphones. Really Samsung? You could not get one of your premium phones to work with one of your premium headphones with your premium settings? As for battery life, this exceeded my expectations. I've found the battery life listed usually is aspirational for the product. However, the listed life of of 10 hours is pretty accurate when used with, for me, lots of phone time (around 1.5-2 hours) and audio the remainder of time. It lasted around 12 hours at work just listening to audio on and off a bit.Overall the sound quality, battery life, and noise cancelling make these a good buy. Some of the negatives outlined above do not offset positives and I would recommend them.",

Once I changed to them, wow!, the ANC is for real and the sound is as good as before: UHD. Of course, you'll still have the complaint of the low volume, but I knew that before hand.",

The sound quality is much better then I expected too. These are close to Bose over the ear headphones if I have to make a comparison (good solid bass).

No concerns come to mind, just be sure to find the right fit for your ear with the supplied ear pieces and you'll be rewarded with those nice highs and lows mentioned.",

In fact, the only connection problem I've had is when I had 2 Bluetooth compatible devices nearby when I went to pair it with one. It would often automatically quickly pair with whichever one it encountered first. If I forgot another one was close by I would get frustrated when the device I wanted to use couldn't see the headphones because they had already paired with, for example, my phone that I forgot was in my pocket. So if a device that usually connects with your headphones fine suddenly stops seeing it, start looking around to see if you' we got another Bluetooth device nearby. The sound is great and it's lightweight and very comfortable. I had some trouble figuring out which way to put the earphones in my ear - does not seem obvious from looking at them (to me anyway). But once you look at a picture and notice the \"handle\" sticks straight out towards your nose it's pretty easy.",

The product on my hair was a little sticky, and it claims it had brushable flexible hold, not really seeing this happen. In fact I would recommend that, if you like your hair to stay on your head. I could go on, but I think I've said enough. In short, if you're looking for just hairspray, this is the one and the scent doesn't completely make you cough and gag, which is a plus!",

I really like that it doesn't have an obtrusive-alcohol smell (being non-alcohol spray) so won't dry or damage like many sprays will.",

The only thing I didn't like is the sound it makes when you spray the can. Don't be alarmed if your dogs suddenly start barking at you like mine did. It is a little loud forced air sound.",

There's a nice smell but not so perfumey that it makes me sneeze, and your skin feels nice and clean after it's on. It's thick, so you don't need to put very much on at all, just maybe a pea-sized drop under each eye and another on your forehead. The directions recommend using the cream morning and night, but I prefer a lotion with an SPF for daytime, so I've only been using this at night. I do feel like my skin looks nice and soft and fresh in the morning, so I'm happy with it.",

I bought another kind way back when and I broke out in a rash and my face swelled up. Since using Australian Gold this has never happened. It keeps my skin moist and soft and I never feel dried out after being in the sun. I am a sun worshipper so I need to have some protection. I do not burn easy and find I like the 4 the best as I get a beautiful tan without burning. When out with my friends they are always using my lotion. Also I love the smell of the lotion. Everyone says I smell like a pina colada. I usually have on hand at least two or three and have a bottle in every beach bag. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

(Especially if you have nails - be super careful, as I have already broken two nails opening this product). It's a shame because the product itself is wonderful - smells great, works great, delivers perfect oomph and volume to your hair, leaves it wonderfully lightly scented, decent price, and is an overall great product. I ended up simply prying the cap open before I go to use the shampoo/conditioner, and pouring it into an empty bottle from another shampoo brand.

This is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that fixed that problem. I had even tried an expensive hard water shampoo that didn't work nearly as well. Even if you don't have hard water issues, this shampoo really made my hair feel lighter and way more voluminous.

I've tried high and shampooed that claim my hair will be voluminous and I have to say that Aussie is by far my favorite !

I also noticed that after using this cleaner that my lenses would roll up over night and I would have a hard time getting them to straighten out.

At first, I thought that the bottle wouldn't last very long. It proved me wrong, though. The bottle lasted just as long as usual contact solution. I will never go back to normal solution now.

Then No Rub all of a sudden disappeared replaced by a box with instructions saying you need to rub. However it's the exact same product. Turns out it's a new government regulation forcing the solution manufactures to remove No Rub and provide rub instructions. My theory is the big pharma owned lens companies didn't like the idea of people not rubbing and tearing their contacts and having to buy new ones all the time so they got their bought and paid for government agencies to make new regulations forcing the new rub instructions. Now people will start rubbing and tearing their lenses again and buying new ones all the time and big pharma and their government buddies will once again be happy. Just a theory.",

While it can be hard to tell the difference between this and the cheap stuff the first day or two, I noticed the difference after several days. For example, with cheaper solutions, regardless of the length of daily wear or how long I allowed my lenses to soak in the solution, the lenses became less comfortable as the day progressed and the protein build-up produced blurry-patches in my vision. Using this cleaning solution, I noticed that my lenses were cleaner and more comfortable for longer periods of time furthermore, when used in tandem with the REPLENISH rewetting drops, my lenses overall felt cleaner, clearer, and a lot more comfortable to wear in the long-term. If you've previously had bad experiences with contact lenses due to any of the issues I've mentioned, you might consider trying this stuff.",

Also, as the day went on, regardless of how many drops I put in my eyes, there was still a protein build-up. So, when I saw that this product could deal with both problems (keeping the eye/lens moisturized and dealing with protein build-up), I decided to give it a try. As soon as you give these a try, you can notice the difference between them and other eye/rewetting drops. It has been approximately 2 weeks since I starting using these I've noticed that my lenses consistently feel more comfortable, and I'm using these drops less frequently than regular drops. These drops are great!",

I bought re-wetting eye drops and would have use multiple times a day just to get through my shift, and then when I would get home I would occasionally have difficulty removing my contact as it would stick to my eye. I struggled through like this for 2 months (thinking it was just that particular contact at first and not wanting to waste the bottle) but I have finally had enough. I have bought ReNu instead and will throw out the 2nd bottle from the pack.",

Wasting more solution than actually using... She's right! You responded that it must be a problem with only her bottle, but it's the same with ALL your bottles - too much is WASTED because of how the liquid comes out. Maybe it's the design - the hole I even wondered if you designed it this way so customers would have to but more sooner. Whatever the case, I stopped buying your product because of that.

After my eyes cleared up (which took over a week), I tried the PureMoist solution again, and within hours my eyes became very bloodshot and uncomfortable again. I immediately stopped using PureMoist, and it took many days for my eyes to no longer be bloodshot. They were still uncomfortable however, as if there was dull painful pressure in one eye, so I went to the optometrist again who saw that I had developed an edema (swelling).

I used some red eye drops which helped for a bit, but the redness came back after wearing them again the next day. I finally realized the issue started when I switched to this solution. I have worn contacts for years and never had an issue like this. I'm switching back to BioTrue which has never given me an issue.

It's as easy as shampooing your hair since you only leave it on for 5 minutes, we'd recommend doing it all in the shower. We tried it outside the shower it dripped a little on the bathroom floor. Since we didn't notice it until it had dried up, it cause quite some bit of staining, Doing this in the shower would allow any castoff dye to be washed away immediately. Overall, the dye application was easy the results were better than expected, As a black american with extremely coarse hair, I think that is the main reason why the color didn't take completely on his head. Would recommended this product to all of the men there that wanted to wash their gray away. The box says that it might last up to 6 weeks, but after just a few weeks, we're noticing that the gray is showing up enough to do a reapplication. And since my husband's beard has more gray than his head, I would recommend using the Jet For Men Beard at the same time. We didn't because my husband's face is extremely sensitive.",

The user should buy a box, pick a time to leave the solution in (like 6 minutes for example) and then rinse it out and check the result. The next time, you will know if you should leave the solution in longer or shorter. You'll also need to keep the number of days between treatments the same for reliable results.

The concept is nice but the product is poor!!!! The coloring doesn't last near as long as the original formula. A good thing gone bad in my opinion. If I had to make a complaint about the original formula it would have been the coloring didn't last long enough but now with this new NO DRIP formula the color fades away even quicker!!! It appear they got good ratings on the original H 60 formula. They should have at least posted both formulas and seen which one sold the best as opposed to totally eliminating the better product and not leaving their customers a choice but to purchase the NO DRIP under performing brand. I have quite a few friend that used this product in the past and we were totally satisfied up until they discontinued the original H 60 formula and went to this new NO DRIP formula. At this point we're saying good bye to a product that served us well in the past!!! I hope they consider putting the original formula back on the shelf in our area. If they haven't taken the original formula off the shelf in your area you may want to stock up with it. I'm sure we're not the only one's that don't like the change!",

The next time, I applied it to my temples first, waited 25 minutes, then hit the rest of my hair, the dye staying on my head for 30 minutes in total.

There's also an option to view the episodes in its original & modest special effects mode, preserving the old school ways for certain purists of the series.If you are a die-hard Trekkie, this is the evasive piece of sci-fi nostalgia you have been waiting for during the last four decades. Every facial nuance, uniform fabric fiber, and ship corridor floor stain is revealed in excruciatingly vivid detail as only blu-ray can deliver. Another bonus is that each episode is complete, unlike the various edits and chops that go on when watching the series in syndication.It's like watching the series fresh all over again. Plus, it's a bonus that Best Buy had a great sale on all three of the seasons.Live Long & Prosper. ;)",

Hey, it is \"Star Trek: The Original Series, Season 1\"!Cons: Mostly minor: special effects not as \"special\" now, but, good for the time.The transfer of this series to Blu-ray has resulted in it being and looking better than it was when it was first shown on NBC back in the '60s(I am old enough to remember watching it then). While the special effects may not hold up to today's standards; they were pretty good for a rather unsophisticated audience. It was the story/plot that was the important part of the show. The late Gene Roddenberry used his show to talk about the issues of the day(which a lot of good and bad science fiction has done for over a century); and used the show to good advantage. The special features consist of a feature going over the re-mastering the video and audio of \"Star Trek(all three seasons)\"; \"All Access(PIP interviews and commentary, etc.)\", the home movies by Billy Blackburn, various 'Easter Eggs', interviews and profiles; these all help fill out what made ST:TOS work. Highly recommended!!",

Instead of being distracted by the original limited special effects; the new special effects create a even flow throughout each episode and help enhance the story of each episode. The new special effects are great and are really exciting to watch.The drawback to this set is that it's in HD DVD. It seems like the DVD industry is going to Blue Ray, so in a few years it may be hard to find a HD DVD player to play this set. The other side of each disk plays on a regular DVD player. Each side of each disk plays the same episodes, but there are some special features that are only with HD DVD side and some with the regular DVD.The special features are NOT on one disk by itself, instead the special features are spread thoughout the set with some of the episodes. Also, some of the special features are out of date. They have a special features on both William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, but both interviews were done in December 2003. I do believe that these special features were offered in the Regular Star Trek: TOS DVD set released in few years ago. It would have been nice to hear their opinions on the updates concerning the special effects.Overall, I would recommend on buying this set. Each episode is complete, not like the edited versions you see on television. The special effects are excellent. Maybe in a few years there will a DVD Player that can play both Blue Ray and HD DVD DVD's.",

Navigation thru the discs is really a cool task, showing up on the Enterprise screen, with some really neat graphics and sounds. The Video uses VC-1 Compression and the colors are vibrant and detail is crisp, while preserving the 4:3 original ratio.Audio is presented in 7.1 DTS Master Audio and will thrill the listener, with a superb balance, incorporating use of discrete effects with maximum results. The Intro theme with the Enterprise whisking by will leave you in goose bumps, overall the Sound has been scrubbed and perfected into an amazing soundtrack!Some of the Special effects in the original series are quite dated and Blu-Ray exploits the old technology, so included in this set is the capability to toggle to more modern cut scenes showing the planets and the orbiting Enterprise. Purist's will appreciate this capability..I really have to convey to any Star Trek TOS fan, that this 1st season on Blu-ray is essential, it will make you feel like you are watching the series for the first time, with its beautiful 1080P high definition picture and 7.1 DTS MA sound track will leave you with a huge smile!I love this first set and will purchase the other 4 seasons with relish!",

The plots still hold up very well and many aspects of the series were far ahead of their time; both socially (racially diverse crew) and technologically (communicators, voice-controlled computers, medical scanners and telemetry).

But on Disc 1, the very first episode on it is Stardate 1513.1 which would really make it Episode 4 or so.

Locks dont stay locked and if you put hot or warm food in foget about closing until its cooled. They will not stay closed. Don't freeze in them because the locks break off. They also break off by just normal use. As far as storage I feel they take up more room because of the 4 locks. Very dissapointed in this product. Wish I had not thrown the old ones away.

I was making lunch for my husband I (Tuna on toast) and decided to do a taste test of both brands. I found that the Bumble Bee had a better flavor and it was dry like Brand S. I know that sounds funny hearing that a tuna packed in water is dry but I think you know what it's like when you have meat or fish that is dry tastes like it was overcooked. Well, that wasn't the case for Bumble Bee. It also looked better in the can. I will buy Bumble Bee from now on.",

I never noticed having any problems throughout the day at my job. However, like most I have tried it starts failing by the end of the day. I honestly can't tell a difference in the quality of scent in Axe compared to other brands. It's time to seriously consider Axe when buying hygiene products.

I can now admit that I have never been so wrong. After using the Axe Phoenix Antiperspirant for around a week now I have come to the conclusion that this may be my new favorite! Now that you know how I feel, let me explain why Since I tend to have a very active job that forces me to sweet often having a deodorant that last is very important. After continues usage of this product I can say that I have no fears of it letting me down halfway throughout my day, and most likely would be able to be comfortable with using this product for over 24 hours, Yes! it holds up that well. In addition to the durability the scent of this antiperspirant is very appealing and seems to also last throughout the day. Now yes I truly enjoy this product and would use it daily, although there is one aspect that could be seen as a negative, this antiperspirant stick seems to be very dry. Due to this dryness little flakes of the stick due seem to come off occasionally. In addition to the flakes I have noticed, due to the dryness, that this product goes on best when used right after showering. All in all I personally enjoy using Axe Phoenix Antiperspirant and would highly recommend to others! This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I have to say, I love this! The deodorant formula, as well as the scent, is light, but lasts all day. The only problem is the deodorant itself tends to cake on the case/packaging after applying it, which can make a mess if you don't wipe it off before it dries. There's no flaking, or staining after application, or after a long day. All you need is a few strokes under each arm, and you are ready for the day.

Now for you customers who are curious about this deodorant, it'll work, just remeber that since it is a stick, not a spray, you got take off the cap, and roll it on, now it'll last awhile, usually around most of the day, as long as you're not sweating the whole day through, and it doesn't stain black clothing as well This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I personally sweat like crazy, and if I'm being totally honest, usually smells like tacos with onions in them. Not with this product though. Sure I was sweating a little bit (you can't get rid of 100 of the sweat, even with clinical deodorant) but you know what, I was confident that I smelled amazing, and I did. I made my wife conduct the old smell test, and even though there was a little sweat, I smelled no where near as gross as I should have. I smelled professional and like I had just got out of the shower according to my wife, so we know it's woman approved. I'm definitely adding it to my daily product usage, along with my beard oil, and hair/face oil. I even checked the inside of my shirt, there were no deodorant marks that you would usually get from other brands of deodorant. Whether I need to use it for business attire, or for when I'm going to the gym, I'm confident that I'll be dry and smelling great. I would definitely recommend that others try this product.

Therefore many stick antiperspirants are more focused on the odor aspect, so gels or cream antiperspirants tend to work better.

This scent had a very chemical like smell that i did not prefer. I try'd this deodorant again the next day and the same results happened. The third day I tried it i tested it to last longer by putting more on than usual. I am sure some people will like this odor i just can't stand smelling it all day it gets annoying. I Had the same expectations as when i used AXE body odor in the past and i have received the same results. The branding label of the Deodorant is very well done.

I first used the color vibrancy mask on dry hair, covered it with plastic and let it sit for about 10 minutes. For the last 2 minutes I ran a blow dryer on the hottest setting over my hair. I then showered. I rinsed the mask off then applied the shampoo only to my roots and washed out after no more than a minute. I then used the conditioner and let it sit for the remainder of my shower before rinsing. This also has a great strawberry smell that lasts. I can't believe how much blonder and shinier my hair is after just one use! I received these products free/complimentary for testing purposes in my first VoxBox, but all opinions my own.

They have a great smell, which helps easing the strong smell of the coloring products. 2. The color on the hair doesn't look fake. 3. Hair looks shiny bright!! 4. Very easy to comb, soft, silky hair.

So now when I go to get cookie pans out the cooling racks are right next to them. So easy. I also like that you don't have the cookie sheets (or pans) sitting on the bottom of the cabinet with everything sitting on top of them and I have to pull everything out and put everything back before I can even start baking the cookies. And after that I'd have to start trying to find the cooling racks!! This is definitely better!! As far as installing this product, there was absolutely no problem. Lynk gives you everything you'll need including extra screws!! Takes about 5 min. from unboxing product to having finished product completely installed. It was so unbelievably fast. We've installed this cutting board/cookie sheet (pan)/cooling racks roll out organizer and 10 other roll out cabinet organizers from Lynks and although they aren't cheap, we think they're worth it. Target got the product to us quickly, it arrived in 3 days with no rips or tears in the packaging and product itself was packaged very well with no problems.",

I can't use a lot of creams, even the ones that say they're for eczema because even they irritated my skin, especially any broken places. I started using this cream in addition to the steroid, and my skin started healing better and feels thicker, stronger, and more elastic, the way normal skin should. I like the combination of the heavier moisurizers, like glycerin and petrolatum, along with the lighter meadowfoam oil. It gives the cream a nice consistency, not too heavy and not too light.

With our extrememly dry skin, on top of other sensitive skin issues, we have been recommended Cetaphil brand products by my dermatologist and our pediatrician. So I trust the brand.

Any review prior to mine pertain to the old formula and should be disregarded.",

I am very impressed at how well it moisturizes my skin and my girls'. It keeps our skin feeling hydrated for a long time, too. I was unsure about the size of the tube since we go through so much lotion here, but since it is an intense cream a little does go a long way. I would buy a bigger size, if it was available. With our extrememly dry skin, on top of other sensitive skin issues, we have been recommended Cetaphil brand products by my dermatologist and our pediatrician. So I trust the brand. I did recieve this product as a sample to try in exchange for a review, however I can say with all honesty that I am very impressed and will be purchansing this regularly in the future.",

Diaz is divine the woman of Stiller's dreams...Dillon is hired to find Diaz...He falls in love with her and gives Stiller a bum story... Lee Evans, a pizza boy, is in love with her too... then Brett Favre comes into the picture. Every scene has something memorable from Dillon's attempts at reviving a dog to Stiller's \"pre date entertainment.\" A classic that doesn't take itself too seriously.",

While partly slapstick comedy, its all done in line that makes sense for these characters/world. Some may argue that it hasnt aged well, and to some degree that may be true. This film was for every grown up in the 90's, but today it's targeted audience may be a bit more narrow. Perhaps the Ferrelly brothers didn't lose their touch as maybe everyone just grew up. I loved this movie in it's day. So as to not base on nostalgia, I must assert that this isn't for everyone. The story and events are very continuant. The comedy though, isn't as deep as some folks may like their content to be. If you ever heard about Cameron Diaz being a dropdead knockout, it was this film (and The Mask) that put her on the map.",

Instead of moisturizing my lips they just leave a heavy, waxy residue that eventually congeals into a white film that I have to awkwardly wipe off. Yeah, not a pretty sight. But the other day I saw this in the store by chance. I like milk, I like honey, and there were only two tubes left on the shelf so I figured it was worth a try. I'm a guy so I didn't want something that would be overly fragrant or glossy, and I couldn't be more pleased with this. The scent and flavor of milk and honey is very subtle (yet delicious!) and it is light enough so it doesn't leave any sort of sheen or residue. After a week of use my lips are noticeably softer, healthier, and more hydrated. The only downside is that it softens up very quickly in my pocket due to body heat and it makes me worry about it melting in the warmer summer months. For women with purses that shouldn't be a problem. Other than that I love the product and I will continue to buy it as long as Nivea continues to make it! (Hint hint- please never discontinue it, I beg of you!)",

The video and audio quality on the other hand is a little lacking. Both to me would score a 3 out of 5 and its hard to understand why more time wasn't put into making the quality shine. Both just seem rather bland. Excellent movie, but only a small step up on the quality of the product.",

I was bothered that after seeing previews showcasing a large amount of Godzilla and battles, the film itself is very thin on monster action and the big buy. The characters/acting were uninteresting, except for one Bryan Cranston, and nothing else seemed to blow me away. After taking some time and seeing friends love the movie, I decided to give Godzilla another shot on 3D Blu-Ray.I am happy to say that I did enjoy Godzilla more the second time, but it still has its problems. The somewhat lackluster performances and hidden Godzilla still bother me a little bit, but overall now I see the film in a positive light. The 3D was incredibe during well lit scenes and just good during darker ones.If you were disappointed with Godzilla on first viewing I recommend giving it another chance.",

Also the fan has a bright function LED light that you can turn off after setting it ONLY on the unit not the remote. BUT every time you change anything the LED comes on full bright.

The nice cool breeze mixed with the barely noticeable \"white noise\" and you have the PERFECT fan for an office which is where mine is.",

IMO it is superior to the classic big fans because its size (tall and skinny) Don't get me wrong this wont help much on the superhot and humidity days if you dont have AC installed in the room but it works superb along with the AC blowing either in your window or central AC. Quiet in sleep mode and gives you a delicate breeze. Oscillating speed is perfect! You dont need a faster oscillation, this tower fan has it at the perfect speed so no complaints here at all. I will buy one more for sure before next summer!! Five star rating!!",

It has a light diming feature which I don't feel is really necessary. My issue is that the timer feature cannot be controlled by the remote. Since I now have private summers at night, I would like to be able to reach over on my night stand and set the timer for the fan to go off without getting out of bed to do so and if you set timer before getting into bed, if fan does go off and you want to reset timer, you have to get up again. Yes you can turn it on/off by remote but why not be able to set the timer by remote. I wonder if it is worth returning for lack of this feature. Other than the remote not having the timer on it, it is otherwise a good fan. Hence 4 stars rather than 5. It would be nice if they would issue a new remote with the timer on it without having to buy another fan.",

Unfortunately my local Wal Mart does not carry all the colors that the website lists only a very fair, this buff, and a fairly dark tan, so I do need to use a tinted mineral veil to finish it. I also find that I must keep very well exfoliated moisturized with this, as it accentuates any dryness a LOT. I have very sensitive skin, with pores that clog very easily, and have had no problems with this. I can't use talc'd gloves on my hands, so would never try a talc-based face powder. The price is much, much better than the mineral powder make-up I have used previously, and covers as well or better. If the next-darker shade is ever stocked locally I'll try it.",

It left my hair in kinks or it was really frizzy. I stumbled upon a video using these curlers. A week later I went to Walmart and bought them. I used them that night, the curls turned out great! The only downside to these curlers is that your first time using them can be a hassle. It's quite easy to figure out, but it can be a bit time consuming the first couple of times. They also aren't the most comfortable to sleep on (I do this method over night), because they do have plastic on each end of the curler. The ends of my hair also come out a little wonky so I have to touch those up with a curling wand. It isn't much heat so it's not too damaging. None of the curlers have broke, but I think I've lost one of the pink ones. I use eight of these curlers in my hair. Four on each side of my hair. My hair goes below my breasts. My hair isn't super thick or thin. My hair is also very fine and prone to breakage. My hair holds curls/waves very well so I can just take these out in the morning, fix anything with a curling wand (if need be), and spray a light amount of hairspray and I can head out and the curls last all day! I use the pink ones because I like looser curls. If you have long hair, I recommend to use the bigger curlers, and if your hair is short, use the smaller curlers. It just looks best. Unless you want super short, very very voluminous curls, use the small curlers on long hair. (I would do that, and then pin one side of my hair to the back if I were to go on a date). The smaller the sections of hair you use, the tighter the curls are going to be. The bigger the section, the looser the curls. ALWAYS wrap the hair around the curler away from your face. It makes you look better. Wrapping it towards your face makes people look little kiddish. Towards the back of the head you can alternate which direction you want to wrap the hair around, and it will give your hair nice texture. NEVER brush out the curls unless you want a big ball of frizz on top of your head. If your curls happen to come out too curly for you, run your hand under water and then grab the curl and wet it with your hand. It will weigh it down and loosen it up.",

I could not figure out how to use a curling iron correctly, use the flat iron to curl my hair, and the no heat/overnight stuff never worked. My hair always turned out frizzy and just a mess. I never do reviews, but this product was so awesome, that I just had to! These curlers were so easy to use and my curls really do seem to shine and bounce all day. The best part was that I saw such wonderful results my first try because it was so simple, no having to learn with practice like with curling irons and other heat products. I also don't have to worry about damaging my hair with heat, which is really important since my hair is a little damaged and dry already. The one thing that does make me cringe a bit is trying to sleep overnight with the curlers. Though I do suggest 100 to have the curlers in overnight, they can be uncomfortable. Still, I cannot stress enough how wonderful this product is by it's simple instructions and wonderful results. I highly recommend these curlers!",

I stumbled across the concept of using rods such as these and instantly had to have them after seeing the beautiful curls they gave. I ordered a few different diameters on Amazon but also went out to Walmart the same day to see if they had them in store. I tried them that same night after my hair had dried about 2/3 of the way (though I did have to re-dampen some sections of my hair), using the smaller rods up top and the larger ones on the bottom. Once they were all in, I used a little bit of hairspray and slept with them in. My hair was so insanely curly the next morning, so I combed through the curls with my fingers and a small amount of argan oil and it looked fantastic! These come in so many different diameters, so if ringlet curls aren't for you, you can also get looser curls or waves. Also, they lasted my entire eight hour shift at work (where I'm always moving) and longer, even with me constantly touching my hair. I have yet to try all the different sizes I now own, ranging from 3/8 to 1 but I'm sure they will all work wonders. I love how quick this is to do as well, even with my thick hair and how I can do it at night and just simply take the rollers out in the morning and fix it up how I want and be done. I would highly recommend these rollers and spiral rollers/flexi rods in general. They give better results, in my opinion, than hot tools and are so much better for your hair!",

Best part is NO HEAT to damage hair. I have burned myself too many times with wands and gave up. Wrap your wet head in these and wake up with beautiful curls by morning. Easy breezy. I did wrap my head in a scarf before bed to keep the wands close to my head. After that I used the blow dryer a little bit (while scarf was on) to take away a little dampness and again in the morning before taking them out. Just pefect!",

I had a 70s theme birthday party to attend and decided to put these on my dry hair 8 house before the party. An hour b4 the party, I took them out and was amazed at how pretty the curls came out. I sprayed some hairspray and brushes the curls out a lil to create a disco big look and my hairstyle stayed gorgeous all night long. I recommend this if you chose to not use heat curlers and want something to hold up all day/night. It's best to have them in for 6-8 hours (best to sleep in them).",

Well after 5 times I learned how to use this product. I need 3 packages for my hair. I untangle my hair then when my hair is damp I start putting these in my hair. I use pin clips to separate the sections of hair. Start off with an L about an inch and a half from scalp. Then you will grab about I'd say 1 inch sections of hair for thick hair and 2 inch sections for thin hair. While you are wrapping your hair around flex rod you will have to twist your hair at the same time. 2 twists per circle until you reach bottom. Make sure the ends are secure as well. I always leave an S shape. Works well. Leave in for a minimum of 6 hours for good results. (Keep in mind do not have these tight on your scalp because they will leave an ugly crease hook at top . Just have it started to where it's just enough not to hurt your scalp).",

I use this to highlight my cheek bones nose bridge inner eye corners above my lip and on my chin. The consistency does not look glittery. When applied to the skin there is a beautiful glow when you face hits certain angles. This really does brighten up the face. There is silvery iridescent shimmer. I have not experienced any crusting on the top like the other reviewer stated. I use this more then my NARS highlighters. I would purchase this again. A little note: I don't know if this would be suitable for all skin tones. I have extremely fair skin and I am very pale. My best friend tried this and she has a more darker skin complexion and this did tend to look a bit chalky on her. So other then that I highly recommend this product as a highlighter.",

It did leave a light blue stain but the gooey came off with boiling water.

Twenty some odd years later a friend wanted to borrow the sweater set I tryed once again to get out the stains even sent it to the dry cleaners. The stain was there to stay. or so I thought.

Unfortunately I would catch it after they came out of the dryer and it was hard as a rock and wouldn't come off. I blamed my son for leaving candy and gum in his pockets. Then I realized what it was (my new TIDE pods). I thought I must be doing too big of loads so I tried them in smaller loads of maybe a pair of jeans with four shirts. The same thing happened. My guess is that these would work great in a regular washer but not in the HE, as they use so little water....the pods cannot fully dissolve. I will have to go back to using a different product.

A simple pour bottle is just plain common sense. Keep the old packaging.",

When we first got them, I thought they were dishwasher pods and when we noticed they were for our washer, we thought what a great idea as principally they work the same. Most importantly, the detergent did a wonderful job in cleaning our clothes. I would recommend them to my friends. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

We were contacted by the owner afterwards that the white sheets had blue stains that wouldn't come out. We couldn't figure out how an entirely white load could get stained with blue but fortunately the owner was very nice and refunded the whole damage deposit. Mystery solved this week when we used Tide pods in our front-loader and found the seal coated in blue slime on 2 consecutive loads. We have been using TIde Pods for about 2-3 months and this is first time we've seen any blue stains. However, we have had unexplained bleached out spots on our dark T-shirts since using the Pods. I like the pre-measured concept (esp with front-loaders prone to smelling if using too much detergent) but current version of Tide Pods are unacceptable for home use. I'm going back to liquid Tide HE and PG needs to take Tide Pods back to the product development lab.",

Why not come out with a Tide and Downy classic scent For those of us who never thought the scents needed to be changed in the first place. I'll still buy other Tide scents and other PG detergents, ONLY because all other detergent brands smell like glass cleaner to me.

I didn't notice any special scent, nor did I notice anything special about the cleanliness of the clothes. That may be because I don't have especially filthy laundry. The clothes are clean, and they smell ... fresh, if that's the right word. It's an interesting concept to not measure the amount of detergent, and I'm not sure I'm entirely comfortable with letting go of that control (yes, I do have control issues, why do you ask). I have not yet priced this product in the store, nor compared it to the number of loads from a regular bottle of liquid, so I don't know if it will suit this budget shopper's price point.

I went to the store yesterday with Tide Pods on my list, but when I arrived at the display, I saw 3 scents, none of which are the original Tide scent. Not only are these not my preferred scent, but I can't even smell them to see how they smell! These scents aren't available in normal liquid packaging so that idea is moot. Long story short: I didn't buy them. Please, Tide, make these in original scent AND give us a way to smell the scents in the store! As for now, I've requested a sample from this site so we'll see what happens. As for now, however, I'm still the sad customer who wants to buy, but can't.",

I tried dissolving them in a dish before placing in washing machine. the white part opened but the other two did not. The material surrounding the white liquid was slimey and had to be thrown in the trash. TIDE should do more testing before selling such a shoddy product. I will never use the PODS of any kind again.",

You might think they don't dissolve, but they actually dissolve when the wash cycle starts. I only wash in cold water and they work for me. I will only use pods from now on, and will recommend them... This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

The shirt came out with the ring around the collar dirt and sweat build up from a summers daily wear. I complained to my boyfriend about it and he swore that Tide always got the dirt out but I'd forbid him to spend money on it. So I went to the store and picked up unscented Tide and threw the shirt in to give it the test. The shirt came out absolutely clean. The ring around the collar grime was gone and I didn't even use bleach. I am really impressed with the results but the price I just can't agree with.",

I was thrilled when I saw a new product on the shelves at Sam's that would help me avoid the mess that comes with the larger, spout containers that I normally buy, and had no qualms about buying the big package, because I trust the Tide brand for quality. Well... lesson learned. One pack didn't get a load clean, so I had to switch to two. Then I noticed that the packs weren't dissolving completely. I tried making the loads smaller so there would be more water to dissolve them, hoping I could find a way to use the packs until the box was finished, but even this didn't help. I ALWAYS wound up with the sticky mess, and if i didn't catch it before putting my clothes in the dryer, I wound up with a rubbery blob stuck to my clothes. After ruining four shirts this way, I gave up and have the almost full box sitting on the laundry shelf, adding to my list of things to dust. So much for saving time- rewashing clothes that have sticky goo on them, and saving money- using twice as much detergent and replacing ruined clothing blew that apart. All that's left to do is to look on Pinterest for craft ideas for my unused Tide Pods.",
