It wakes your senses and leaves your hair feeling flowly and beautiful. I've been using this for 2 months and it works pretty decently. at first, for the first week or so, I acquired dandruff because of this conditioner (and the shampoo), and a lot of my hair would fall out. But I kept using it and eventually learned to use it in a certain way so my hair would be feeling good after the shower. I have naturally straight hair and i have A LOT of hair--its all pretty healthy, but I like to give it that extra moisturizing hydration so my hair isn't so dry at times. my routine for awesome hair: 1. wash/rinse hair with warm water 2. lather shampoo all over hair, scrub and massage hair from roots to ends 3. rinse with warm/lukewarm water 4. apply conditioner to mid-ends of hair and massage it through hair, (it may depend on your hair, but for me, I can not apply conditioner to my roots--it makes my hair fall out) 5. rinse entire head of hair with cold water. the cold water closes the cuticles of your hair strands and keeps the moisture locked in. this product is great for natural hair types and leaves your hair feeling refreshed, light, flowly, soft, silky, and gorgeously beautiful.",

I do like to drink something to overpower the taste after a few minutes just so it doesn't linger. I like it because I find it easier to use traveling and in public than the wash/spray/paste. I would recommend trying this product for dry mouth.",

I really liked it so I was anxious to try the Biotene Gel Oral Balance. First of all, it was, for me, an alien concept to swish gel in my mouth. It's a clear gel but it's very thick. It's a strange sensation until you get used to it. It really works! My mouth felt hydrated for a good hour after using it. It struck me how convenient it is to have the gel wherever I want to use it. No need to spit anything out which makes it even more convenient. I work in a lab where we are not allowed to have food or drink inside. My mouth gets terribly dry. Now all I have to do is squeeze a little out (I put it on my fingertip) and swish it in my mouth, pressing it against all the surfaces with my tongue. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 was the taste. It's some sort of minty taste that I found unappealing. Others may like it but I didn't care for it. The benefit far outweighs the negative, though, and I will continue to use this innovative product.",

Not really sure how to solve this problem, since I have never experienced it before, I jumped on the chance to try Biotene gel. I have heard of Biotene's line of products, and this one seemed simple enough for a newbie to use! I applied a drop of the gel to my tongue as the directions suggested, swirled it around in my mouth, and immediately had to suppress the urge to retch! The flavor itself was good, but the texture of the gel and having to use my saliva to break it up somewhat to help it spread around my mouth was not a pleasant process for me. I would say efficacy-wise it was on target...my symptoms were relieved for several hours after, however I don't believe I will use this product again due to the gel texture.",

I applied some to my mouth and I noticed that the box stated that it should last for about 4 hours. 4 hours is a good amount of time to last if you don't wake up in the middle of the night. Needless to say, I tend to wake up from time to time throughout the night. I woke up that night and not only was my mouth dry again, but also had a funky taste from the gel.

I particularly like that the ingredients are safe to swallow, though I choose personally to spit it out in the sink after making sure I swirl and swish it all around the inside of my mouth per the package directions. Due to prescription medications which I'm taking and some dental issues, my mouth is constantly severely dry. I have tried drinking more water, chewing gum, and using other products for dry mouth. All have helped a wee bit. I find that this specific product helps more and it also lasts for a longer time. It works for up to 4 hours! The reason I am giving it 4 stars is that I think the taste of the product could be significantly improved. It works well so I will continue to use it. I would, however, like to see better flavors offered in the future. Thanks, Biotene!",

I used to swear by it for solving dry mouth problems overnight where long-term efficacy was required. However, the NEW! PH-balanced formula has been watered down so that its effectiveness longevity has been severely compromised. In addition, the new formula has a very caustic or acidic edge inevitably one is going to have to swallow some of this goo during use, and in my case (and many others -- read the reviews on Amazon and on Biotene's web site) the formulation provides a very unpleasant throat-burning experience for a good 20-minutes after it is applied, which certainly doesn't help one get to sleep! This new product seems about as far from pH-balanced as you can get. The only reason I buy this product anymore is because it's the only real player in the game for relief that lasts longer than a couple of hours, and because I can still blend it with the contents of some travel packs of the old gel that I still have and have found more of online. After that stash runs out, I don't know what I will do. I guess I'm hoping Biotene realizes they made a huge Coca-Cola reformulation error and restores the old formula -- or at least remedies the horrible caustic edge this formulation suffers from. Wal-Mart does have the best pricing I have been able to find to date (another problem with this product -- it's ridiculously expensive -- prior to the reformulation you could buy it for 3.99 / tube).",

I start with a little bit on my tongue - coat the inside of my mouth and add more if I need it. Helps me get to sleep and stay asleep longer. If I wake during the night I am able to grab the tube and use a little more without turning the light on. Not a miracle cure but it helps quite a bit. It seems a little expensive but you really don't use much. I expect this tube will last me about one month.",

I have tried the biotene mouth spray and that works well enough, but I have to say that the gel is much longer lasting. The gel also seems to taste a bit better too. Chemo causes your body to become very high maintenance, so whatever can give you an edge and last longer between applications is a godsend.

It is also very tough- it lasts easily twice as long as any other polish I've tried on my toenails. I've been wearing the lime green shade for about a week and a half, and it looks just as good as it did on the first day. The thicker texture makes it easy to apply to toenails (I do 2 coats). Sometimes I use the 30-second top coat for extra shine.

This is a beautiful color but is difficult to remove and stains nails and skin red that it comes in contact with the product on what is used to remove it. I am willing to try another color to see if it is just the red before I completely give up on product because I love the quick dry! Nice to not nick nails or get on clothes like with normal products.",

I'm on Day 3 with no chips as of yet. I also had no problems with staining like the others did. The color I used was Magenta Moves. It's really more of a reddish color but not as harsh as a typical red. LOVE the color, hope they make this product forever. I'll never buy another type of nail polish again after trying this product.

This is easy to apply, dries super quick, and the colors are fabulous! I've used racey rouge and mint sprint so far...gorgeous! The only negative is that the polish will stain your nails. I fixed that by using the diamond flash quick dry top coat as a base coat, then apply polish, and then apply diamond flash as top coat. The result is super shiny nails and no staining. I had minor chipping toward the end of the week on my index fingers, but not bad at all and easily touched up. I LOVE this polish and want it in every color!!!",

I am one that has problems with nail polish chipping anyways but this chips like crazy.The Racey Rouge I bought thinking it was a pink and when it's on my nails it looks the prettiest red with a pinkish tint I wish I would have known that so I didn't buy the mess in a bottle red also known as Miracle Nail Growth because I need a new red and the other brands weren't the color I wanted little did I know by buying this pink I'd find a very pretty red/pink.Mint Sprint I bought because Teal is my favorite color but I don't find much occasion to wear it except when I'm randomly feeling like I want teal nails.I'd still say buy it if you want a fast drying polish but be warned you'll have to deal with chipping and having to repaint them more often",

My toddler doesn't like to sit and \"wait\" either most nail days with her and myself would end with smudges and bad home mani pedi (using a kids safe polish). The quick dry makes our nail days much more fun and a event that happens more often due to quick drying time. To me when I use the top coat this polish last about as long as any other. We have several shades and haven't experienced any \"staining\" like others. It honestly does take one coat to give you full color. The only con I would have to say about this product is the bottle. the shape makes it wobbly when dipping. I love the flat brush but the bottle is awkward and the opening seem a little small for the width of the brush, but this isn't enough of a deterrent to prevent me from continuing to purchase it. This was the first adult polish I used on my toddler and I'm impressed with drying time most definitely and the vibrancy of one coat of polish. Will buy more.",

I literally painted my nails only a few minutes before typing up this review.- The brush is fantastic. It's wide and allows for a more even coverage. I can paint my thumb nail in almost 1 brush.- The colors are great. There are many to choose from. I am wearing Lively Lilac right now. Looks wonderful- It looks great with only 1 coat! I like that I don't have to go over them 2 or 3 times to get great coverage. 1 coat and I'm done.- Lasts a long time! I've gotten up to 2 weeks of wear out of my polish before it starts to chip or peel.I am definitely hooked on this product and plan on buying all of them.

Only today did it begin to leave marks on papers. Application was easy requiring only one coat of color to achieve solid results without streaks. Removal was moderately easy, requiring three cottonballs using non-acetone remover because my daughter doesn't like the acetone odor. My nails were not stained. Co-Bolt blue gets all five stars. I purchased this polish a while ago.My daughter bought Petal Pusher. The polish is thicker. It is a light color, so it streaks. It doesn't dry as fast as my Co-Bolt blue. I had to put on three coats to get decent results, defeating the purpose. I don't know if she got a bad bottle or one that had been opened at the store, but this color was definitely inferior to the co-bolt blue color.I'm willing to give it another go though, and will purchase one in yellow to see how that goes. I will update review with those results.",

I also do not like the difficulty in removing the polish. I had to purchase a 100% Pure Acetone Remover to get the polish completely off and use a lot of cotton balls. This polish is very very messy trying to remove it from your nail and gets on everything. It also chips very easily and requires constant touch ups. It would be very nice to have a product that dries instantly and does not crack when you due daily activities like washing your hair. To correct this problem I purchased your No Chip Acrylic Top Coat and tried it with the Insta-Dri polish but I still have the problem. I then tried the No Chip Top Coat by itself. Well it laster one day and one hair washing and my hair is very very short. I am very unhappy with the No Chip Top Coat that I purchased to keep my nail polish from chipping because after one day I removed it because over half of my nails were chipping very badly. My nails looked like I had polished them over weeks and the No chip top coat was a mess. I am very unsatisfied with the No Chip that made no difference at all. THEY CHIP WORSE THAN THE OTHER TOP COAT THAT I WAS USING THE MAXIMUM GROWTH TOP COAT. My pedicure seems to last a lot longer with out chips but they always have. The only problem is my finger nails that are longer but not too long just clear of my finger. Please try to come up with a better No Chip product and a Insta-Dri that comes off easier with less mess.",

This product is waxy and feels like a stiff helmet like coating. The edges were broader and skin stained darker. Also the previously colored ends looked really dark. I had to use a color remover to get ends to lighten. I will go back to original or try another brand.

I was buying some gear to go camping and seen monkey butt at the counter , I asked the person if it worked and he said yes he uses it so i got a small bottle. 24 hours later my butt was on the mend after being battered for all those years. Now once a week I will apply boudreauxs butt paste just to hydrate and protect, I'm cured , I would have paid allot of money for a cure .. I had jock itch once and if anyone knows how painful it is, the cure is pennies. you would literally spend thousands if there wasn't a cheap cure...

                "review_text": "It's a shame that I've been having so much trouble finding Burt's Bees Cocoa Lip Shimmer in supermarkets lately, because this is by far my favorite color in the set. It seems to have been replaced by Plum, which is a much more orangey-red and doesn't go to well with my skin tone... Oh well. All the lip shimmers are great products and (I think) superior alternatives to lipstick - they show up differently on everybody (skin tone seems to play an important role in this), but once you find your color, you will have a lip product with natural and understated, yet noticeable, hue. It is not nearly as thick and pasty as lipstick, and has a great mint flavor and scent which allows you to surreptitiously lick it off if need be. The Cocoa shade has a purplish-gray, almost metallic look to it when applied. It doesn't look nearly as gaudy as I'm making it sound, and the color works very well for me, a pale, dark-eyed brunette.There are a couple disadvantages to the product: It is very slick and will never dry or solidify on the lips, which means that it is just as liable to rub off onto your teeth and hands an hour after application as it is a few minutes after and something about the texture greatly enhances every flaw in the skin of your lips as you rub them together, which means that every single biteable nub that you never noticed before is going to be screaming for your attention until you take care of it. The Lip Shimmer is also stupidly expensive for less than an ounce of product, but this is Burt's Bees, after all. Overall, if you are an infrequent makeup wearer or not fond of lipstick for most of the obvious reasons (terrible taste/smell, gaudy shades), this is a great alternative to achieve some slightly subdued lip color - but if you are an everyday wearer, you might try to find something a little less expensive.",

First of all, this doesn't smell very good. It's not awful, but it's a strong scent and I don't like it at all. Secondly, it basically doesn't work. With the other ProMend, my split ends were all but invisible after I used it and straightened my hair. With this, my hair was stiff and didn't move very well, as well as got very tangled because my split ends hadn't molded back together as they had with the previous incarnation. Don't get me wrong, it's still better than drugstore brand protectants like Tresemme, but I don't think I'll be using it again. It comes in a tiny bottle, smells funky, and doesn't do what it says it will. Not worth the cost.",

I thought it was my eyes for several days and just switched to glasses. Absolutely no problem with my glasses. Next I switched to a fresh pair of contacts. The same problem occurred within hours. It was bad enough that my vision seemed to have changed. As a last ditch effort, I went to the pharmacy bought a bottle of my regular Opti-Free Replenish. Cleaned my contacts, let them soak for a bit rinsed them off. It took a few cycles of rinsing, but after that there were no more problems. I will never use the Puremoist again. An expensive lesson because I cannot find the receipt. I trusted the brand and never thought there would be such a severe problem switching from one version to a supposedly better version. I'm very disappointed with the Puremoist. On the other hand, I'm very happy with the Replenish.",

I have to admit I was very skeptical in the beginning, but after I watched the first previews I wanted to see the movie and what can I say? It blew me away.I liked the animal, Mowgli, the whole setting etc, etc. The story differs a little bit from the animated version, but I've read it's closer to the original book from Rudyard Kipling. But anyway, I was 5 again, the magic of a Disney movie caught me after a couple of minutes. All involved actors doing a great job. I'd highly recommend this movie. I'd give 6 stars if I could",

CONS: - stainless steel top is a thin veneer. scratches easily. after only 2 WEEKS of gentle use started separating from substrate and formed air bubbles underneath, so it doesnt look or feel flat anymore. protective plastic film left residue after removal that i cant seem to get off with soap/water, vinegar or steel wool. - the flat shelf seems flimsy and i worry about it warping or cracking over time. - drawers only open 1/2 way... very weird design. you'd have to remove the stuff in the front to get to anything in the back. i'm not thrilled with this item.",

I first seen this movie in 2D and was entertained, but seeing this again in 3D was amazing, to my knowledge the film was specifically made for 3D, all of the color, fine details and depth are not lost and looks smooth and sharp and brings you into the experience right from the first frame.

You shouldn't miss this one. Scarlett portrays a mesmerizing and hypnotic snake which on its own , is worth the price of the movie.",

Two brothers who have a rather bad habit of ruining big family events like weddings and birthdays are in the doghouse with their parents. While their sister wants them to come to her wedding, she doesn't want them coming alone to try and hit on her bridesmaids. If they can't come with dates, they aren't allowed to come at all. Since they do love their little sister, the overgrown children come up with a plan to find dates that their family would approve of. Unfortunately for them, 2 girls that are as bad as they are learn of the trip and pretend to be the women that would be the perfect fit. From there on, the movie goes through the various adventures of the characters often ending poorly, even while the two dates do their best to avoid being discovered for who they are.It is funny, but some of the humor will be considered in poor taste and there is some nudity so not for the kids. Good for some laughs (and a few groans too).",

Since the noise wasn't a problem during the daytime we left it turned on and discovered that it is spewing out little drops of oily residue onto the wall and/or carpet behind the fan.

I started using this moisturizer a few months ago, along with a total effects cleanser. I don't know what went wrong. Maybe the Olay for you lady swapped my profile with someone else's...because this just wasn't for me. I didn't notice any line minimization, lifting, pore refinement, or visibly younger-looking skin...which were all selling points for me. I also thought the moisturizing was a little over the top. It even left my skin feeling slimy until I cut back from using it daily, to using it every other day. Once I did that, I was very satisfied...but seeing as I'm not overly enthused about this cream as a whole, I wont be buying it again.",

The only caution is on the tub/shower version. I missed this warning/caution in the instructions regarding using 1/2 inch pex on the mixer to shower head pipe run.....DON'T. If you did, then you'll get a little bit of water flow out of the shower head when you're trying to fill the tub. The water backs up the 1/2 in pex and there's not enough back presser to keep the water from flowing out the shower head. Use \"as noted in the instructions\" 1/2 copper or iron pipe. I've changed out the 1/2 inch pex and installed 3/4 inch pex but you'll have to get 3/4 in pex to 1/2\" pipe dog ear elbow from another vendor. HD doesn't have them in stock at my local stores. The larger diameter pipe allows for sufficient back pressure to prevent the water from backing up the pipe and flowing out the shower head. 1/2 inch pex is too small of diameter.The product works and is of nice quality. Just read \"all\" of the instructions so that you don't miss this caution as I did. To much, I know what to do because I've done it so many times before so I didn't read the instructions. My bad! Should always read the directions and then install.",

Just For Men Haircolour covers all the grey, although the resulting colour is usually slightly lighter than anticipated after the prescribed 5 minutes (so I normally leave it a minute or so longer). Only real problem is the dye runs easily. However hard I try, I usually get some running down my cheek or neck.How about a gel form One other thing, because I wash my hair daily, the colour washes out within a few weeks. Overall, very satisfied with the product, especially with the 1 off vouchers I receive periodically.",

Upon installing these bulbs in various fixtures around the house, I have noticed that every one of the Feit bulbs flicker - reacting to the slightest frequencies. Initially, I attempted to just put up with it, because they were cheap, but now it has become increasingly irritating. In comparison, the Phillips LED bulbs I purchased have a warmer white light, and they also do not flicker. So yes, the extra few cents I saved by going for these cheap Fiet bulbs - definitely NOT worth it. Go for quality, not quantity.",

I appreciate the thought which went in to this new delivery mechanism for laundry cleaning agents, however they don't work for me in their current state of development. The main positive is that the cleaning power and the results are what I would expect of a Tide product. The negatives are 1) using cold water in an HE washer, I find the pods not dissolving as quickly as expected, thereby lessening the time the agents are in contact with the clothes, 2) the Mountain Spring scent impresses me of citrus and bubblegum, not at all like the Mountain scent of regular Tide liquid, 3) almost all of my washes are multiple, small loads because I live alone and this strikes me as a waste of the pods, which can handle large loads (perhaps a mini-pod version might be offered, however people might just try to use them on large loads, anyway, and then complain about insufficient cleaning). For now, I'll stick with Tide Totalclean, which is the best overall product for cleaning and softening clothing that I have ever used.",

                "review_text": "One might call Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates director Jake Szymanski's feature debut and to a degree I guess that's correct as this is his first film getting a wide theatrical release (and his first that runs over an hour), but Szymanski is no stranger to comedy or the space in which it occupies in Hollywood. In fact, Szymanski turned Andy Samberg's rather thin idea for a 30 for 30 parody into a rather entertaining forty-five minutes last summer. All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Mike and Dave is anything more than one might expect it to be (it's not) and despite sounding like one of those straight to VHS American Pie knock-offs where you might find Tara Reid and the chubby kid from The Sandlot working not-so hard to earn a paycheck, Mike and Dave actually delivers on the promises and premise that have been set up in its marketing. Though it might seem obvious that 20th Century Fox would like to make something of a comedic brand out of Mike and Dave (Mike & Dave Go to London, Mike and Dave Take the World) it somewhat feels as if Szymanski and writers Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien feel the opposite. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is very much a contained story that gives our main cast of characters defined arcs that take them from one clear point in their lives to the next. What is nice about what both the writers and Szymanski do though is that they don't allow this transformative period to completely define these characters. The titular siblings are still very much who they were in the beginning of the movie at the end of the movie save for the fact they've learned a few lessons and earned some perspective. What I'm saying is that Mike and Dave doesn't turn into a fable of some kind where the intent of the film is to teach its characters and audience a lesson, but rather is more about the challenges and obstacles presented in a certain situation and how a specific type of person deals in the messes they've made. This is undoubtedly the films strongest trait in that it doesn't become wholly what we expect though it is mostly the obtrusive and familiar raunchy comedy you hoped it would be if you bought a ticket in the first place. That said, Mike and Dave delivers some modest pleasures for, despite largely adhering to the beats of the genre, it excels in hitting those beats through a likable and appealing cast.",

                "review_text": "What's the point? That's the question director Jon Favreau and the brass at Disney had to answer if they were going to justify the money and man hours required to bring the visually stunning \"live action\" version of Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book to the big screen some fifty years after the Disney animated version taught generations upon generations of children the bare necessities of life. What would be the point of retelling this story to the current generation in an updated form? What more could they bring to it that children might not elicit from that 1967 original? In short, would there be more of a point to it than simply showing off the technical wizardry of Weta Digital and their visual effects work? The funny thing is, we more than likely remember the 1967 version through nostalgia-filled eyes that cloud our judgment of the actual film. In going back and watching that film-the one I very much enjoyed as a child despite being born in the late eighties-it quickly became apparent there wasn't much substance to the story and that the film was more a collection of little scenes filled with different, but interesting animal personalities that featured catchy songs written by the Sherman brothers and very little more until Shere Khan showed up at the end to create some type of tension. And so, going into this latest version of Kipling's story that would pull from both that source material while being heavily inspired by the '67 film the biggest improvement they could make would be in the story department by crafting a narrative that held a driving force with serious forward momentum and a throughline plot that, at the very least, would add a little more significance and reason to seeing the film in the first place. With screenwriter Justin Marks (whose only prior feature credits include a Street Fighter film and a TV movie) though, we are brought the one thing I couldn't even have imagined to add and that was a cohesion to the thinly connected events of the original animated movie. Giving purpose and connection that take Mowgli (Neel Sethi) from point A to point B lends the film a real ambition making the stunning visuals only more of an achievement.",

                "review_text": "There is a bit of trivia on the IMDB page for Independence Day: Resurgence that talks about how, after the success of the first film, 20th Century Fox paid screenwriter Dean Devlin a large sum of money to write a script for a sequel. The story goes though, that after completing the script for what would have been the original sequel to 1996's Independence Day Devlin decided not to turn it in and instead gave the money back to the studio. The trivia goes on to state that Devlin did this because he felt the story didn't live up to the first film. As we are now twenty years removed from that original film and have now seen what an Independence Day sequel looks like this course of action only seems to beg one question: how bad must that original sequel script have been? Could it really have retreaded the beats of the first film as much as Resurgence does? The only thing that differentiates the first film from this new one is the passage of time and how that has changed earth's technologies and defense systems while having what cast returns look a little older. The IMDB page goes on to say that it was only fifteen years later, when Devlin met up with director Roland Emmerich to try again, that they felt they had finally \"cracked\" a story for a sequel. Though it is difficult to be downright negative towards a film story and character development certainly aren't Resurgence's strong suits and may even be the most laughable aspects of a movie that tries really hard to be funny. One can't help but feel that, in this scenario, \"cracking\" the story only meant they were offered a lot more money than before. If Resurgence does indeed deliver the story that Emmerich and Devlin thought more justified the existence of a sequel to their 1996 feature it can only now be concluded that they were only going to repeat themselves more with the scrapped screenplay. While Resurgence certainly finds moments of dumb fun and some rather spectacular action sequences given special effects have improved greatly in the last two decades it is more or less a retread of what we saw in that original movie in terms of ensemble cast and humans versus aliens. Granted, the question easily posed in response to that statement is, \"what did you expect it to be?\" and the answer to that is that they at least try to find a new way into that same old story.",

After finding great success with The LEGO Movie and the fact they acquired the likes of Phil Lord and Chris Miller who directed 21 and 22 Jump Street (as well as Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, to their credit) to helm that hit animated movie the thought of continuing to try their hand at bringing in R-rated comedy directors and seeing how they operate within the world of children\u2019s entertainment is a ballsy, but interesting move. Much like with the case of The LEGO Movie Warner Bros. was likely hoping this formula might produce something both mature and goofy with the plus of remaining consistently funny throughout the majority of its runtime. It makes sense and what better way to test said formula than with the likes of Nicolas Stoller, director of such films as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and the two Neighbors movies, thus the reason we now have Storks. Because of this inclination to take someone known for one thing and put them just far enough outside of their element, their comfort zone if you will, I was inclined to be more interested in this seemingly agreeable animated family movie than I might have been otherwise. I love it when directors or studios cast an actor known for one type or style of work, especially comedians, and place them in a different setting where we see them challenged in new/different ways that usually result in a more fascinating piece of work by virtue of the outside influences and persona that performer brings with them. That is kind of what is happening here though maybe not to the extreme of, say, Jim Carrey in The Truman Show. Rather, Stoller is being challenged by the limits of a PG-rating and how far he can go with his comedy inadvertently forcing him to be more creative with how he comes up with the laughs needed for a 90-minute children's film. And so, how does all of this hype and build-up effect the final product? Well, in many ways this is a disappointment when considering the potential the film had considering the interesting premise, its insanely talented and funny voice cast, and of course the presence of Stoller in the director's chair. Instead of producing anything unique or of distinguishable value Storks more or less plays by the rules of Pixar and DreamWorks movies where the narrative sees a couple of characters going on a quest to achieve a goal that will allow them to discover new things about themselves along the way. There's nothing especially wrong with this structure especially when executed in fun and interesting ways and Storks certainly has its quirks, but more than anything the film feels far too routine to be a product of someone who should have really been challenging themselves.",

It also needs some repair to the handle latch.This Hoover is much easier to use and it does an even better job. We were concerned that there was no height adjustment, but this works equally well on carpet, hardwood, and vinyl floors. The handle for stairs is especially useful, as we have two carpeted stairways. The vacuum is so light it isn't a problem.In spite of the bad reviews on the canister, my wife loves it too. It is so very light it is easy to vacuum out the cars, and the long wands reach to the high ceiling on our back porch. It seems to have a lot of suction, and the noise is no worse than any other vacuum.We definitely wanted a bag vacuum, as emptying a no-bag vacuum is a messy operation. With the bag, you just remove all the dirt and dust and it is already bagged. Also, the bag offers a very large HEPA filter that is changed automatically when you need to change it. In one step you neatly empty the dirt and replace the filter.",

Now that I am using Just For Men, no one knows, which is what I want. It seems to leave just a tinge of grey and the colour is not so drastic. Also with other products, my scalp would be extremely itchy for a few days after colouring and I do not experience this with this great product. I am totally sold on Just For Men Haircolour and have been using it for a few years now.",

The cinematography was a pleasant surprise, as the shots tend to be very much in the style of old Hammer Horror films (Horror film buffs should keep an eye out for shots that resemble some of your old favorites). The soundtrack is a nice mix of Danny Elfman's score and 70s rock. This is used to great effect throughout the movie (most notably Nights in White Satin).The film is not Burton's best, nor is it Depp's (Both of which would be Ed Wood in my opinion). It is an entertaining film, nothing particularly special... but there's a sense of nostalgia to it... Both for fans of the show and old Burton fans.",

True, the original concept would have made 'purists' happy, but Depp, while acknowledging ALL the built-in comedy, intentionally (I hope) down-plays the humor, making it work even better. Michelle Pfeiffer was WONDERFUL as Elizabeth Collins-Stoddard! Forceful and pragmatic. And beautiful, of course! Helena Bonham-Carter (My FAVORITE Ophelia!) was FANTASTIC as Dr Julia... even down to some of the mannerisms used in the TV show... I must admit that I thought the 'adjustment to the pedigree' was added a bit too late, but after watching it more-than-once (which is EASY to do) it bothers me less each time I watch it. I must acknowledge the cameo of the original Barnabas, Johnathan Frid, at the 'happening'. NICE touch! I originally saw it in the theater and vowed that I would own it when it came out on DVD. Preordered. DONE! I cannot think of ANYTHING I truly disliked about this movie... Nothing at all!",

The sodium is the problem. With three pats of salted butter you've got about 15 of your recommended sodium in one muffin 22 on a low sodium diet.

Other lightening products have made my hair yellow, but you can really feel the quality in this. The result is a very natural subtle lightening/ highlighted look. You need to give this a try.

We have five inside dogs but never have to worry about odor.....not when LYSOL is around! It kills the pet odors and leaves a clean fresh smell.

I sprayed the chair thoroughly, wherever I might touch it, when using--gave it a few minutes to dry, sat back down in the chair again--and NO MORE COOTIES! I am sure now, the chair was covered with Staph germs, invisible to the naked eye. I spray down most surfaces when I enter a client's room to ensure their Health Safety and my own.

I can't control germs everywhere, but I can control/ eliminate the ones in my home and vehicles. I get a cold maybe once every two years, and I believe Lysol helps keep me and my family healthy. (I also use Lysol disinfecting wipes, Neutra Air spray, and foaming hand soap.). I have one request for the company- PLEASE bring back Lemon scent. It was, by far, the best scent. It didn't just sanitize and disinfect, but it smelled great! I could use it as an air freshener, as well (which cannot be said for all of the scents). Lemon scent and Linen scent are the only two scents I can use that don't force me out of the room after spraying. Some of the scents have an underlying smell that forces me to leave the room until it has dissipated. Original scent was the absolute worst to have this affect almost had a bug spray smell to it. Lysol has come a long way since that first spray. Lysol: I absolutely love the Lemon scent and cannot believe it was discontinued. Please bring it back. Thank you!",

Set the A/C to draw outside air and run it wide open for a minute or two drawing through. Reapply if necessary. Be sure to open your windows to air it out since the odor will be strong, but it will kill the fungus and mold in the system and the smell will go away.

I do have a concern though. I work in a gym childcare and a co-worker of mine loves to spray Lysol over everything at the end of the day. From reading the can, the toys should be rinsed off after they have air dryed, my guess is to rid them of any residue. She thinks they are fine but I'm worried about the little kids mouthing the toys the next day and ingesting the residue. Do I need to enforce the rinsing off",

Most chap stick moisturizes the surface of your lips then dries out the rest of the lip, including the surface! One of my favorite things about it is that it last's so much longer than any other leading brand's when your drinking anything, in the shower, or even swimming Vaseline stay's tight to your lip's. That's why I love Vaseline's lip therepy. They even have it colored pink for dressy occasions. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I already plan to pick up the Aloe version as soon as it's in stores. First thing I noticed is the size of the tin. It isn't an itty bitty tin you can barely get a pinky finger in. This is a very nice size: not so small you'll run out in a week and not so big you can't pop it into a small side pocket in your purse. Next thing I noticed was the the very soft, nice scent when I opened the tin. To my nose, it's not entirely a cocoa butter scent. Maybe a super-faint baby lotion type of scent But it's by no means overwhelming or something to deter you from trying. My lips were well moisturized for an extended period of time: I'd say longer than when I use regular Cocoa butter, but about the same as with one of the mentholated chapsticks. Pro Not sticky Super convenient to use and carry Not too small a decent amount of product Cons It comes in a tin, which means you'll have to use your fingers or buy some type of small tool to dip into the tin and spread on your lips.

This is about the closes you can get to Dr. Dan's Corti Balm in my opinion, and it's much cheaper. If you need to just keep your lips moist and I chapped I would definitely get this, but if you have a major problem get the Dr. Dan's. All and all this is a fantastic product.",

Worked wonders with in just a few days. One little tub lasts for ever, but I lost it, went right away and got the Cocoa-butter version. I like it much more then the original. Nice mild scent much thicker and smoother. It still feels a bit greesy, but the nice silkyness makes up for it. The active mosterizing from the cocoabutter seems to work faster as well. The only down side, the girlie pokes a bit of fun at me for using and raving about a product with cocoabutter.",

The only thing that could make it better is SPF, because I'm afraid the glossiness in the summer. Also, the packaging is really cute but it's hard to get the product out of the container when it starts to get near the bottom. I have long nails, so it's okay, but if a man with larger fingers and short nails was trying to, it might be extra difficult. Might think about a squeeze tube or something.",

I have been trying different things but (a) I'm really picky, (b) when my lips are chapped I want totally clear so it doesn't stick to teeth, and (c) I hate most flavors as they make me feel nauseated, so I've not found anything that I fell in love with. On top of that, some actually caused an itchy rash *around* my lips! I also wanted to grab some regular Vaseline for a rash my doctor recommended it for, and I thought it may help my lips...I actually think the container is super cute and just use the back of my nail to get it out, and rub any excess on my hands. Immediately I fell in love with the very light scent and shine, and keep expecting to need more only to find it is still on after meals, drinking throughout the day, talking, etc. Also since its clear I can put around the edges of my lips and the side creases where mine crack without looking like a clown. It feels...absolutely luxurious. I also can put my regular lipstick on with Vaseline Lip Therapy over it for protection and shine. I've been reading about other uses for regular Vaseline and am so hopeful for other skin irritations they haventvreally been able to fix, that at least I can get some relief! So yes, I am thrilled with my cute little jar and plan to stock up - definitely recommend to anyone for year-round use!",

I already plan to pick up the Aloe version as soon as it's in stores. First thing I noticed is the size of the tin. It isn't an itty bitty tin you can barely get a pinky finger in. This is a very nice size: not so small you'll run out in a week and not so big you can't pop it into a small side pocket in your purse. Next thing I noticed was the the very soft, nice scent when I opened the tin. To my nose, it's not entirely a cocoa butter scent. Maybe a super-faint baby lotion type of scent But it's by no means overwhelming or something to deter you from trying. My lips were well moisturized for an extended period of time: I'd say longer than when I use regular Cocoa butter, but about the same as with one of the mentholated chapsticks. Pro Not sticky Super convenient to use and carry Not too small a decent amount of product Cons It comes in a tin, which means you'll have to use your fingers or buy some type of small tool to dip into the tin and spread on your lips.

The only thing that could make it better is SPF, because I'm afraid the glossiness in the summer. Also, the packaging is really cute but it's hard to get the product out of the container when it starts to get near the bottom.

I don't have any wrinkles and the really fine lines I do have are under the inner corners of my eyes. I think the slack is naturally there (they didn't show up with age) for closing the eyes so I can't comment about how the moisturizer affects any lines or wrinkles. I do like the feel of it and have a temporary glow after I apply it. It goes on very smoothly spreads nicely where a little dab goes a long way, it absorbs instantly, doesn't feel greasy or heavy and keeps my face feeling soft and looking hydrated for the entire day, the dispenser is great keeping the product clean and dispenses easily so 4 stars for these points. The only thing I don't like about it is that the fragrance is a bit strong for me. I like the scent, but would prefer if it wasn't so strong so I would get the fragrance-free version of this. I only notice the scent for a few seconds of applying it and can only smell it again if I have something around my face like a scarf but I would still get the fragrance-free version - the less chemicals on you, the better! -1 for the strong fragrance. I would continue to use this as a summer, autumn, spring daytime moisturizer but only as an overnight moisturizer during the winter. I think a heavier cream would be better for the winter cold and wind. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",

I just got back from walking my dog and felt no such sensations at all in the cold and wind thanks to Olay's Total Effects. I scrubbed my face with a pumice wash meant for hands (something I use once a week) and then applied the moisturizer after the rinse and went out. I was impressed that for a lotion that feels so light, it really did its job in the southern Canadian cold! I was out for about 30 minutes in moderate wind and my face felt fine.

I have been trying different things but (a) I'm really picky, (b) when my lips are chapped I want totally clear so it doesn't stick to teeth, and (c) I hate most flavors as they make me feel nauseated, so I've not found anything that I fell in love with. On top of that, some actually caused an itchy rash *around* my lips! I also wanted to grab some regular Vaseline for a rash my doctor recommended it for, and I thought it may help my lips...I actually think the container is super cute and just use the back of my nail to get it out, and rub any excess on my hands. Immediately I fell in love with the very light scent and shine, and keep expecting to need more only to find it is still on after meals, drinking throughout the day, talking, etc. Also since its clear I can put around the edges of my lips and the side creases where mine crack without looking like a clown. It feels...absolutely luxurious. I also can put my regular lipstick on with Vaseline Lip Therapy over it for protection and shine. I've been reading about other uses for regular Vaseline and am so hopeful for other skin irritations they haventvreally been able to fix, that at least I can get some relief! So yes, I am thrilled with my cute little jar and plan to stock up - definitely recommend to anyone for year-round use!",

My lips are generally bad. Of all the problems, they are the most painful, and quickest to break. After trying many things, I saw a little tub of the original lip theory, and said what the heck. Worked wonders with in just a few days. One little tub lasts for ever, but I lost it, went right away and got the Cocoa-butter version. I like it much more then the original. Nice mild scent much thicker and smoother. It still feels a bit greesy, but the nice silkyness makes up for it. The active mosterizing from the cocoabutter seems to work faster as well. The only down side, the girlie pokes a bit of fun at me for using and raving about a product with cocoabutter.",

One of my favorite things about it is that it last's so much longer than any other leading brand's when your drinking anything, in the shower, or even swimming Vaseline stay's tight to your lip's.

This album is held together by the best writing by Jagger/Richards and superb playing by Keith throughout. Handily, the packaging includes a song by song breakdown of who played what.There is little to say that hasn't been said about this album. It even has one of the best album covers.Finally, to quote the liner notes:THIS RECORD SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD",

                "review_text": "Between 1968 and 1972, the Rolling Stones released some of the greatest rock 'n' roll records ever recorded. 1968 saw the release of Beggars Banquest, 1969 saw the release of Let It Bleed, 1971 saw the release of Sticky Fingers, and 1972 saw the release of Exile On Main St. 1969 also saw the removal and eventual death of the founding member of the Rolling Stones, Brian Jones, as well as the introduction of his replacement, Mick Taylor. It was a time of great flux within the band, and with the flux came an absolutely outstanding record.With the release of Beggars Banquest, the Stones decided to stop releasing different versions of their albums for the UK and US markets (typically, the UK market would not release any singles from an album as those songs were considered to have already been released), and they kept that tradition with the release of Let It Bleed (and every album released thereafter). The first single released was \"Honky Tonk Women\" b/w \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" as both songs had been recorded prior to the release of the album itself, and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" appeared as the album closer even though \"Honky Tonk Women\" did not. No other singles were released from the album until 1970 when \"Let It Bleed\" b/w \"You Got The Silver\" was released in Japan.While following the standard blues-rock style that made the Rolling Stones one of--if not THE--biggest and best bands on the planet, Let It Bleed has a rather strong undercurrent of country influence, particularly on \"Country Honk\" and \"You Got The Silver.\" Truth be told, old American country songs were a strong influence on many of the original British Invasion bands, though not as much as the blues or R&B. But the Stones, throughout the course of their history, have paid homage to more than their fair share of country classics. But, at its heart, this is a blues record as are all Stones records, and that's why we fell in love with these guys way back in the early '60s.Let It Bleed has a veritable pantheon of hits. \"Honky Tonk Women,\" \"Gimme Shelter,\" a live version on \"Midnight Rambler,\" and \"You Can't Always Get What You Want\" appear on Hot Rocks 1964-1971. \"Country Honk,\" \"Let It Bleed,\" and \"Monkey Man\" are also incredibly strong songs that could have easily been released as singles. And then there's \"You Got The Silver,\" which is the first-ever Rolling Stones recording where Keith took on lead vocals while Mick (Jagger) manned the harmonica. Sadly, Brian Jones, who was becoming increasingly estranged from the band, only appears on two songs: \"You Got The Silver\" and \"Midnight Rambler,\" playing autoharp and congas respectively.If all you have are greatest hits albums in your Rolling Stones collection, do yourself a favor and buy this album. It's considered to be one of the greatest rock 'n' roll albums ever recorded because, well, it is. Listen to it just once and you'll agree. So what are you waiting for? Buy it already!",

Every mom knows how hard it is to wash something out of a baby's eyes! Washing made it even worse because when you wash it, it starts acting like soap and gets worse! How is a baby supposed to go swimming and/or sweat without this stuff washing into their eyes ADVERTISING MILD AS WATER IS SUCH A LIE! Last time I checked, water didn't burn my eyes unless it was chlorine or salt water! Either case, false advertising! Granted, there is a tiny section on the back that said to keep out of eyes. I don't know about you, when you have a squirming child... You hardly take the time to read the back carefully unless you so happen to be next to the darn bottle while using the bathroom. However, in this case, I didn't go squirting sunscreen in my child's eyes or run it near the eyes. I simply applied the lotion on his face (as recommended by doctors) and any EXPOSED BODY PARTS which in turn, includes his HANDS. Which makes sense unless a parent plans on sending a child out with gloves at all seasons of the year! I admit to poor judgement on my part on not thinking it through clearly. However, as I mentioned earlier on, when one slaps the words baby and mild as water, one assumes it is gentle for ALL PARTS OF THE BABY including the EYES! I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! However, I can make sound judgement that as far as skin use, it is gentle... But after dealing with a screaming baby and struggling to wash it out for 10 minutes, then having the baby fall asleep after the fiasco because of exhaustion, followed by having to wait an additional hour before continuing my plans, I would say this product is an inconvenience to have. It wasn't even his nap time! My suggestion is to do more research and find a better product that is truly baby safe, in all spectrums worthy of using the label BABY. Truly, One PO'ed and Distressed Mother",

Despite other reviews she did not scratch any once applied, my only complaint is that it clumps and cakes up whether I use a thin layer/thick layer/well rubbed in.

You barely have to rub it -- which any parent knows is awesome for wiggly toddlers.2. It's not greasy like other sunscreens. That's the reason my husband hates sunscreen. This one is not like that at all. Leaves your face feeling like you just put moisturizer on.3. It's gentle and has never irritated my daughter's skin -- from 9 months old on. Why would I ever use anything else if this is working so wellGreat stuff -- we have it on our Subscribe Save and love the price this way!!",

                "review_text": "I love Aveeno's lotions, shampoos, and body washes for adults, and I trusted their brand name, so I gave this sunblock a try for my toddler. Before I put it on him, though, I tested it myself, and I am SO GLAD I did. I used it on my face, and people, it STINKS. It smells like you got a splash of gasoline on you at the gas station, and when it's rubbed into your face so that you can't get away from it -- ugh, nauseating! I understand that it is unscented, but the ingredients in it smell like gasoline to me. Even after testing it, though, I was still willing to consider MAYBE using it for my boy, because again, I trusted Aveeno, and I know that different lotions smell different to different people. But then, my husband used it before he mowed the lawn one day, and he came back to me, UNSOLICITED, and said, and I quote, That stuff smells terrible! It smells like gasoline! I couldn't believe it. I had never asked him what he thought, or mentioned to him that that's exactly the same impression I had had! So that settled it: I tossed the barely-used tube into the trash. Before you buy this product, try taking a whiff of it at your local grocery or drug store. If you can smell that gasoline smell at all, don't buy it, because the effect will be intensified once it's on your face (or your poor baby's face!).",

However, my sister DID end up being allergic to it even though it says 'gentle as water'. This isn't a big deal to the two of us being that I just took it off her hands and use it as a normal sunblock, but I would NOT rub this on a baby. My sister got totally red from it. Super disappointed here, because she can't find a sunblock that works for her and she burns easily.. but I can't say it doesn't work for normal skin being that I've used it and it does work just fine for me.",

It was a very tense half hour where we had to work to wash off this waterproof product. After this happened my sister-in-law immediately asked what we had used and she said her daughter had experience the same reaction to this product from Aveeno. The claim that this is as gentle as water is a complete fabrication - we use so many Aveeno products in our home because of skin sensitivities and I was very let down by this product and upset I had relied on this company I trusted to tell us the truth that this was specifically formulated for babies. After this happened I compared the ingredients to my own sunscreen and found all of the active ingredients were the same as my own, adult, sunscreen from another company. We have since switched to the Honest Company 100 zinc oxide sunscreen.",

It protects from burns, doesn't smell weird, doesn't burn eyes (too much), and washes off fairly well, but not too well. However, when I use it on my face, it gives me a rash that lasts for days. It's only a mild rash, and better than a sunburn by far, but still, not so great. My husband sweats it off, but he does that with everything anyway. Overall, it's better than nothing, and works well enough to keep around until something better comes along.",

However, the sunscreen is not like their other products! We used it on him everyday for two weeks at the beach. He would always fight us when we put it on and then scream when we gave him a shower. We thought he was just being difficult until I tried some on my face and got my face wet in the pool and it BURNS and stings! It was a firey sensation on both my face and my eyes. Even when we put it on him and let it sit for 30 min before getting wet, we could visibly see the sunscreen washing off, thus getting into the eyes. I have never seen a waterproof/resistant sunscreen coming off in the water like this. I haven't written a product review before mostly because nothing has been so bad that makes me want to spend the time to write a review but this is a must skip sunscreen! I'm looking for a new sunscreen for him now.",

It was not a pleasant smell, but it did eventually go away within 20 minutes of application. I should also note that the sunscreen did not affect my daughter's sensitive skin/eczema which is great because a different sunscreen we tried made her eczema worse, this one did not and that's why we will continue to buy even though the initial smell at application is less than pleasant.",

Bottom section is 4 tall so small or short items can be separated from full sized items to organize multi-sized items. All sections are open on only two sides which helps prevent items from falling out. Bottom section can be taped to next section to make a pocket to really hold items inside the folder. Main tab is 5 wide for long single line description and about 1/2 lower are inner tabs which are 2 wide. Also each section itself has room for labels, notes, or even attached items in addition to tab space. These are not heavy weight paper but adhesive labels on tabs will make them sturdier. Sections won't hold high volume of pages but pages can be placed on top of the sections for higher volume (same fold lines as standard folder). To use these inside a standard folder, cut off main tab to add flexibility to existing file folders.",

If there is somewhere else to pinch pennies, it isn't with laundry detergent! As far as pouring from the cap, or spigot, I don't use either because I can't really lift that huge bottle, but I buy the smaller bottles and refill those. I don't measure using the cap either, as I pour directly from the bottle to the washing machine dispenser. Clean, no drip, nothing to wipe up and accurate measuring every time. :) Now if my machine would just work right I would be happy again.",

It is not greasy or sticky in my opinion, but leaves a wonderfully hydrating, supple feel to my face and a nice matte finish to boot. My previous sunscreen was fine for the body, but not so great for the face--with the typically added fragrance most sunscreens contain--under my makeup. The old sunscreen burned on application and often left me with new blemishes by the end of the day when I finally removed my makeup. Before the Aveeno, I had very little hope of finding something fragrance-free that could work so well for face and body. I highly recommend this sunscreen to adults (I cannot recommend for babies and children however due to my lack of experience in that department) who are looking for the same solution to otherwise problematic sunscreens with added fragrance that more times than not presents discomfort and problematic inflammation to delicate skin.",

Bradley Cooper did a good job playing his character although there were times when he was acting way too one dimentional. The good thing about it is that Jennifer Lawrence balanced it out and allowed Cooper to shine especially when the two of them are at a scene together. I wish that the movie could have given us more background about the disease and allowed us to see more of the past from both of these characters. All in all, the movie is highly enjoyable and the pairing of both Cooper and Lawrence work strong enough for this movie to be a truly feel good and warm movie of 2012.",

Things take an unexpected turn when he meets kindred crazy person Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young woman trying to cope with her husband\u2019s death by sleeping with everyone at her work.Pat and Tiffany bond over their issues and idiosyncrasies, with \u2018crazy person\u2019 topics like the types of medication they\u2019ve taken. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he\u2019ll return the favor by doing something very important for her \u2013 be her partner in a freestyle dance competition.Silver Linings Playbook is a delightful, uplifting film that soars on incredible performances. Jacki Weaver (Animal Kingdom) delivers a realistic portrayal of a worried, protective mother while DeNiro\u2019s Pat Sr. is a bookmaker and sports fanatic, obsessively arranging his television remotes and rubbing his lucky handkerchief during Eagles games.This is the best DeNiro has been since the mid-nineties. Sure, he was a funny caricature in films like Meet the Parents and Machete, but here he plays a living, breathing person who buries his emotions and attempts to bond with his troubled son over watching the game.A father unable to express his emotions, Pat Sr. is forced to confront his son and in turn, open up and address some of his own emotional hangups. DeNiro deserves Best Supporting Actor for this role and I sincerely hope the Academy recognizes him for his work here.Cooper and Lawrence display versatility and surprising range in their performances as imperfect people searching for a silver lining. Usually with romantic comedies, the reasons for love are inherent: Katherine Heigl is super attractive, Gerard Butler is super attractive \u2013 they should hook up (so I can watch).But here, there is a real, palpable chemistry between Cooper and Lawrence \u2013 they need each other, and we love watching them repair each other\u2019s broken heart and mind\u2026 and of course they\u2019re drop-dead gorgeous and sexy as all get-out, so that doesn\u2019t hurt either.Silver Linings Playbook is one of the best films of the year \u2013 and a great followup to David O. Russell\u2019s 2010 film, The Fighter. I think it gets nominated across the board, from acting to Adapted Screenplay, Director, and Best Picture.A humorous, relatable journey into all matters of the heart, Silver Linings Playbook is a reminder that we\u2019ve all got baggage and problems and stuff to worry about \u2013 but we can get past it and find things that make life worth living.",

I have two issues with this mop: the first is the noise it makes! The swivel connection between the mop head and handle is astoundingly squeaky, and there is no quiet mopping when the babies are asleep! The other issue is that the sprayer mechanism doesn't work, or jams, consistently. Nothing will spray out, and I have found that I have to remove the cleaning solution bottle and put it back in to fix this. Not a big deal, but the mop is only a month old and I am concerned that it will permanently break down fairly soon",

I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! it came in a package of 12 so is perfect to organize my entire 2013!!!, the only think that I am not really happy about is the fact that doesn't come with labels and dont sale as individual items...I would be happy to buy an extra one or two just to add my resolutions list to start my year and the other one for my taxes and to organize my goals to be achieved with my returns. Also, I think it will be a great idea to see them on at least another package of 12 but on different colors for other proyects and ideas around the house, for example: to save and divide recipes, to save appliances warranties and manuals, etc. PERFECT ORGANIZER AND GREAT BARGAIN!!!!!!",

I didn't use the booster a few times after I washed dishes because I forgot I still had half a sample remaining and caught myself re-washing dishes.

I do a lot of papercraft, as well as creative writing, and I've always wished for a folder-ish system where I could organize various documents, templates and various bric-a-brac for a project, especially one that could handle a variety of different sized pieces that will, eventually, constitute a whole. This fits the bill - now, instead of just throwing all the various pieces, of vastly differing sizes and shapes, for a papercraft project in a stack with a binder clip, I can logically lay them out in the product's sub-folders. YES!!! While I am overall very pleased with the product, a few pieces of constructive criticism presented themselves while I was familiarizing myself with these new folders: 1) The covers feel very flimsy when compared with the side of the folder with the pockets. Because of the extra layers on the pocket side, it is much beefier, and, sometimes when I pick a full folder up, the cover pops open and documents can slide out. 2) It would be great to have a few different interior layouts of the product - sometimes when working with a lot of small pieces, seeing as how they would lend themselves to the lowest, smallest pocket, get jumbled up and confused. having a few different pocket layouts could help remedy this. 3) It would be great if the folders came in other dimensions, besides just the standard 8.5x11 size. I work with a lot of over-sized pieces of posterboard and it would be really nice to have folders to help organize them as well. A smaller, pocket-sized version would be very useful as well. 4) This final one is purely cosmetic - the folders come in only three colors. For project management purposes, having seven or eight (or more) different colors would help me keep the folders organized one color per project. Overall, I am very pleased with the product, and, if the need arises, I would absolutely purchase more packs.",

The packaging now states, New Look! Same Great TasteSorry Keebler, but they do not have the same great taste. They don't even have a good taste. In fact, these new cookies are downright terrible. There are barely any chocolate chips in each cookie and they now taste like stale cookies that have been sitting around for a week.Keebler clearly cut some costs on this new recipe and it shows. The quality is extremely poor.If you want some delicious, soft cookies that taste like they are homemade and are reasonably priced, try Matt's Chocolate Chip Cookies. They are by far the best packaged chocolate chip cookies I have ever had....",
